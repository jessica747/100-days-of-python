#we can user input from the consol/terminal
#print("Hello" +input("What is your name"))

'''Without changing the code, try clicking submit.
If a student didn't complete the coding exercise, then the extra tests should catch this.
For example in this case 6 is the correct answer for the visible inputs. But behind the scenes when you submit the code we are also passing in 5 and 5.
5 x 5 = 25
while
2 x 3 = 6
So the only way for the student to pass all the tests in the evaluation is to write the correct code.

This is how we ensure you're doing the right things and test your understanding of the programming concepts. It's like having a teacher next to you checking your code.'''

num1=int(input())

num2=int(input())
